## How to Use

1. **Log Your Progress**
   - Update the table with the current date, the category (e.g., Basics, Problems, DSA), platform (if applicable), task name, and your status.

2. **Use Notes Effectively**
   - Mention any challenges faced, key observations, or improvements made while working on the task.

3. **Categories**
   - Basics: Fundamental C programs.
   - Problems: Problem-solving practice.
   - DSA: Data structures and algorithm tasks.
   - Platforms: Problems from specific platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.

4. **Platforms**
   - Specify the platform (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces, Domikoj, etc.) in the **Platform** column for platform-specific problems.

Happy tracking and learning!
