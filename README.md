# Learn C Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

This repository is designed for those who want to start from scratch with C programming, progress through basic problem-solving, and eventually dive into data structures and algorithms (DSA) practice. It provides a structured learning path with folders for different stages of learning and problem-solving.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-ds-algo-practice.git
   cd c-ds-algo-practice
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
   - Optionally, install an IDE or editor like VS Code.

3. **Start Learning**
   - Begin with the `basics` folder to learn C programming fundamentals.

## One-Click Setup

To create the entire folder structure with sample files for quick startup, run the following script:

### Bash Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create main directories
mkdir -p basics problems/{easy,medium,hard} dsa/{arrays,linked_lists,trees,sorting,searching} \
platforms/{leetcode,codeforces,hackerrank,atcoder,domikoj} solutions/{basics,problems,dsa,platforms} resources/{books,lectures,references}

# Create sample files
echo "// Your first C program" > basics/hello_world.c
echo "// Data types in C" > basics/data_types.c
echo "// Loop examples" > basics/loops.c
echo "// Sample easy problem" > problems/easy/sample_easy_problem.c
echo "// Sample medium problem" > problems/medium/sample_medium_problem.c
echo "// Sample hard problem" > problems/hard/sample_hard_problem.c

echo "# Log your progress here" > progress-tracking.md
echo "# Recommended books" > resources/books/README.md
echo "# Lecture notes and videos" > resources/lectures/README.md
echo "# Reference links" > resources/references/README.md

echo "Folder structure created successfully!"
```

### Usage
1. Save the above script as `setup.sh` in your repository.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```
3. The folder structure and sample files will be created automatically.

## How to Contribute

1. **Add a New Program or Problem**
   - Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., `basics`, `problems`, `dsa`, or `platforms`).
   - Add your program or problem file (e.g., `new_problem.c`).

2. **Add a Solution**
   - Solve the problem and save your solution in the `solutions` directory under the corresponding folder.

3. **Document Your Work**
   - Update the `progress-tracking.md` file with the program or problem name, status, and any notes.

4. **Submit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [folder-name] - [program/problem-name] solution"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Progress Tracking

Maintain a log in the `progress-tracking.md` file. Include:

- Date
- Topic/Category
- Program/Problem Name
- Status (Completed/In Progress/Not Started)
- Notes (e.g., "Needs optimization")

Example:

```plaintext
| Date       | Category       | Name                 | Status      | Notes                  |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 2024-12-15 | Basics         | Loops Practice       | Completed   | Focus on nested loops |
| 2024-12-16 | DSA - Sorting  | Merge Sort           | In Progress | Debug segmentation fault|
```
